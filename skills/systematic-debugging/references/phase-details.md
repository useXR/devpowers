# Phase Details

Detailed instructions for each phase of systematic debugging.

## Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation

**BEFORE attempting ANY fix:**

### 1. Read Error Messages Carefully
- Don't skip past errors or warnings
- They often contain the exact solution
- Read stack traces completely
- Note line numbers, file paths, error codes

### 2. Reproduce Consistently
- Can you trigger it reliably?
- What are the exact steps?
- Does it happen every time?
- If not reproducible, gather more data, don't guess

### 3. Check Recent Changes
- What changed that could cause this?
- Git diff, recent commits
- New dependencies, config changes
- Environmental differences

### 4. Gather Evidence in Multi-Component Systems

**WHEN system has multiple components (CI -> build -> signing, API -> service -> database):**

**BEFORE proposing fixes, add diagnostic instrumentation:**
```
For EACH component boundary:
  - Log what data enters component
  - Log what data exits component
  - Verify environment/config propagation
  - Check state at each layer

Run once to gather evidence showing WHERE it breaks
THEN analyze evidence to identify failing component
THEN investigate that specific component
```

**Example (multi-layer system):**
```bash
# Layer 1: Workflow
echo "=== Secrets available in workflow: ==="
echo "IDENTITY: ${IDENTITY:+SET}${IDENTITY:-UNSET}"

# Layer 2: Build script
echo "=== Env vars in build script: ==="
env | grep IDENTITY || echo "IDENTITY not in environment"

# Layer 3: Signing script
echo "=== Keychain state: ==="
security list-keychains
security find-identity -v

# Layer 4: Actual signing
codesign --sign "$IDENTITY" --verbose=4 "$APP"
```

**This reveals:** Which layer fails (secrets -> workflow OK, workflow -> build FAIL)

### 5. Trace Data Flow

**WHEN error is deep in call stack:**

See `root-cause-tracing.md` for the complete backward tracing technique.

**Quick version:**
- Where does bad value originate?
- What called this with bad value?
- Keep tracing up until you find the source
- Fix at source, not at symptom

## Phase 2: Pattern Analysis

**Find the pattern before fixing:**

### 1. Find Working Examples
- Locate similar working code in same codebase
- What works that's similar to what's broken?

### 2. Compare Against References
- If implementing pattern, read reference implementation COMPLETELY
- Don't skim - read every line
- Understand the pattern fully before applying

### 3. Identify Differences
- What's different between working and broken?
- List every difference, however small
- Don't assume "that can't matter"

### 4. Understand Dependencies
- What other components does this need?
- What settings, config, environment?
- What assumptions does it make?

## Phase 3: Hypothesis and Testing

**Scientific method:**

### 1. Form Single Hypothesis
- State clearly: "I think X is the root cause because Y"
- Write it down
- Be specific, not vague

### 2. Test Minimally
- Make the SMALLEST possible change to test hypothesis
- One variable at a time
- Don't fix multiple things at once

### 3. Verify Before Continuing
- Did it work? Yes -> Phase 4
- Didn't work? Form NEW hypothesis
- DON'T add more fixes on top

### 4. When You Don't Know
- Say "I don't understand X"
- Don't pretend to know
- Ask for help
- Research more

## Phase 4: Implementation

**Fix the root cause, not the symptom:**

### 1. Create Failing Test Case
- Simplest possible reproduction
- Automated test if possible
- One-off test script if no framework
- MUST have before fixing
- Use the `devpowers:test-driven-development` skill for writing proper failing tests

### 2. Implement Single Fix
- Address the root cause identified
- ONE change at a time
- No "while I'm here" improvements
- No bundled refactoring

### 3. Verify Fix
- Test passes now?
- No other tests broken?
- Issue actually resolved?

### 4. If Fix Doesn't Work
- STOP
- Count: How many fixes have you tried?
- If < 3: Return to Phase 1, re-analyze with new information
- **If >= 3: STOP and question the architecture (step 5 below)**
- DON'T attempt Fix #4 without architectural discussion

### 5. If 3+ Fixes Failed: Question Architecture

**Pattern indicating architectural problem:**
- Each fix reveals new shared state/coupling/problem in different place
- Fixes require "massive refactoring" to implement
- Each fix creates new symptoms elsewhere

**STOP and question fundamentals:**
- Is this pattern fundamentally sound?
- Are we "sticking with it through sheer inertia"?
- Should we refactor architecture vs. continue fixing symptoms?

**Discuss with your human partner before attempting more fixes**

This is NOT a failed hypothesis - this is a wrong architecture.

## When Process Reveals "No Root Cause"

If systematic investigation reveals issue is truly environmental, timing-dependent, or external:

1. You've completed the process
2. Document what you investigated
3. Implement appropriate handling (retry, timeout, error message)
4. Add monitoring/logging for future investigation

**But:** 95% of "no root cause" cases are incomplete investigation.

## Human Partner's Signals You're Doing It Wrong

**Watch for these redirections:**
- "Is that not happening?" - You assumed without verifying
- "Will it show us...?" - You should have added evidence gathering
- "Stop guessing" - You're proposing fixes without understanding
- "Ultrathink this" - Question fundamentals, not just symptoms
- "We're stuck?" (frustrated) - Your approach isn't working

**When you see these:** STOP. Return to Phase 1.
